1. Currently my location is: Balia, Paschim Para via Chakdaha, Nadia, West Bengal 741223
   My mother's name is Ira Pande

2. I seldom have any network for talking owing to the small number of towers here, and have to walk for about a kilometre to get some signal to make calls and check SMS messages. Everyone living in my area also have the same problem. In order to attend classes I have to go to a petrol pump to use the WiFi 10 km away because neither the WiFi router in my home and nor my mobile data gets any connectivity

3. i have my own mobile data which worked fine in Delhi, but is very slow here (image attached) due to very less number of towers. All service providers like Jio, Vodafone, Airtel, etc. have very low connectivity

4. We mostly have H+ or E, and rarely get 2G.

5. I have tried a dongle. it doesnt work either

6. laptop and ipad

7. none

8. simple unavailability of connection

9. yes, Satpura hostel
