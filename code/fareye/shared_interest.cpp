/*We define the following:

There are friends_nodes friends numbered from 1 to friends_nodes.
There are friends_edges pairs of friends, where each (xi, yi) pair of friends is connected by a shared integer Interest described by friends_weighti.
Any two friends, xi and yi, can be connected by zero or more Interest because if friends xi and yi share Interest ti and friends yi and zi also share Interest ti, then xi and zi are also said to share Interest ti.

Find the maximal product of xi and yi for any directly or indirectly connected (xi, yi) pair of friends such that xi and yi share the maximal number of Interest with each other.

Name	Type	Description
friends_nodes	integer	The number of friends.
friends_from	integer array	Each friends_from[i] (where 0 ≤ i < friends_edges) denotes the first friend in pair (friends_from[i], friends_to[i]).
friends_to	integer array	Each friends_to[i] (where 0 ≤ i < friends_edges) denotes the second friend in pair (friends_from[i], friends_to[i]).
friends_weight	integer array	Each friends_weight[i] (where 0 ≤ i < friends_edges) denotes the ID number of a Interest shared by both friends_from[i] and friends_to[i].
Note: friends_edges is the number of pairs of friends that directly share a Interest.

The function must return an integer denoting the maximal product of xi and yi such that xi and yi are a pair of friends that share the maximal number of Interest with each other.

Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of friends_nodes and friends_edges.
Each line i of the friends_edges subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < friends_edges) contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of friends_fromi, friends_toi, and friends_weighti.

Constraints

2 ≤ friends_nodes ≤ 100
1 ≤ friends_edges ≤ min(200, (friends_nodes × (friends_nodes − 1)) / 2)
1 ≤ friends_weighti ≤ 100
1 ≤ friends_fromi, friends_toi ≤ friends_nodes
1≤ friends_weighti ≤ friends_edges
friends_fromi ≠ friends_toi
Each pair of friends can be connected by zero or more types of Interest.

Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximal product of xi and yi such that xi and yi are a pair of friends that share the maximal number of Interest with each other.

Explanation 0
Each pair of n = 4 friends is connected by the following Interest:

Pair (1, 2) shares 2 Interest (i.e., Interest 1 and 2)
Pair (1, 3) shares 1 Interest (i.e., Interest 1)
Pair (1, 4) shares 0 Interest
Pair (2, 3) shares 2 Interest (i.e., Interest 1 and 3)
Pair (2, 4) shares 1 Interest (i.e., Interest 3)
Pair (3, 4) shares 1 Interest (i.e., Interest 3)

The pairs connected by the maximal number of Interest are (1, 2) and (2, 3). Their respective products are 1 × 2 = 2 and 2 × 3 = 6. We then return the largest of these values as our answer, which is 6.
